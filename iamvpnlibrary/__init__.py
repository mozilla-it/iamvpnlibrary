        This class does nothing, by design.  The upstream class should
        implement and return structures that remain consistent if you
        change from one to another.  So if you're reading this, you are
        likely more interested in either the parent class of this, OR
        the test suite that calls into this.

        The test suite for this class covers the public-facing calls.
        So if tests pass, your upstream class implements the things
        we have found that we care about.
